# webpack-template

This is a simple template that installs the basic stuff that I need for webpack and other things like eslint and prettier. 

cheat sheet:

run the install script: `bash setup.bash`

run the build: npm run build

run webpack build continuously: npx webpack --watch

linting should be done automatically

prettier: npx prettier --write .
prettier watch only: npx prettier --watch .
